This organization serves as a centralized space for the development, curation, and collaboration around Synapse plugins. Our goal is to foster modular, reusable, and well-documented extensions that enhance the flexibility and capability of Synapse-based systems.

- For developers: Contribute your own plugins, report issues, or help improve existing ones.
- For users: Browse our curated collection of plugins and learn how to integrate them into your Synapse deployments.
